                <p>A short collage animation that came out of my animation class, fueled by a lot of 
                    anger after the November election. I drew all the assets by hand, scanned them in, 
                    and animated everything in After Effects. </p>

                <p>My final project for animation class, where I tried to include every animation 
                    technique we learned that semester—flipbooks, collage animation, and 2D. I filmed 
                    it myself, then hand-drew rotoscope animation over the main character while secondary 
                    characters were animated using cutout collage techniques.</p>

                <p>At ITP's Doc Lab, I work as both a shooter and an editor. I film and photograph 
                    student projects, clean up the raw files, and put together polished edits. I also 
                    interview students about their process and create promotional videos (like this one), 
                    complete with custom graphics, for both NYU and the students to use. Watch some more of

                <p>A card-matching game I coded in GameMaker Studio, designed entirely with my own 
                    pixel art. Every time you play, the card combinations are randomized, so no two games 
                    are the same. I love puzzles like this, and if you do too, you can play it on my 
                    <a href="https://croissanf.itch.io/matchymatchy" target="_blank">itch</a> page!</p>

                <p>A poster I designed in Illustrator, inspired by one of my favorite songs, I Feel 
                    Free by Cream. I broke the song down into its essential parts—hums, beats, 
                    instruments—and translated them into shapes and colors, arranging it all (after many 
                    iterations) into this psychedelic-style design. </p>

                <p>An app prototype I worked on in a group of four as part of my Human-Computer 
                    Interaction course. We set out to create a social media space for Muslim international 
                    students in non-Muslim-majority countries, helping them stay connected with friends 
                    and family back home during Ramadan. Through multiple rounds of user testing and 
                    iteration, we developed this high-fidelity prototype of what the app could look like.</p>

                <p>A game I built with a partner using a machine learning library that recognizes 
                    hand positions and another that classifies images. The webcam records how the player 
                    draws in the air using their finger, and the AI attempts to classify the drawing. 
                    The result is then used to fill in the blanks of a randomly generated Mad Libs story 
                    that is given to the player at the end, creating unexpected stories each time.</p>

                <p>A fully analog, choose-your-own-adventure board game that I made with a group of four. 
                    I did a lot of the writing, making sure the branching paths were complex but still 
                    made sense no matter which way you approached the story, with plenty of hidden Easter eggs. 
                    It's the kind of game where you might not catch everything the first time, but 
                    the more you keep playing the more you'll find.</p>
