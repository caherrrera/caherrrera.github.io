                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p id="greeting">Hi!</p>
                    <p>I'm Carolina Herrera, a Dominican-born creative technologist from Miami, Florida. 
                        I've been drawn to making things for as long as I can remember, from doodling 
                        in the margins of notebooks to shooting videos with friends. That early curiosity 
                        has shaped how I approach my work today: as a chance to try new things and bring 
                        ideas to life in experimental ways.</p>

                    <p>With my Interactive Media Arts major and double minor in Game Design and 
                        Web Applications from NYU, my work blends animation, coding, video, and storytelling 
                        to create interactive and playful experiences. I enjoy exploring how different 
                        tools and mediums can work together to say something unexpected.</p>

                    <p>I've worked on everything from livestream productions to coding games and making 
                        video graphics. Each project has taught me something new and strengthened my passion 
                        for combining technology and creativity.</p>

                    <p>As I look ahead to post-grad life, I'm excited to keep experimenting, learning, 
                        and creating. I'm always looking for what's next.</p>
